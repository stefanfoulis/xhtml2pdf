ABOUT
=====

.. WARNING::
    We are doing some major refactoring. The API and import locations can
    change at any time.

xhtml2pdf is a html2pdf converter using the ReportLab Toolkit,
the HTML5lib and pyPdf. It supports HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS 3).
It is completely written in pure Python so it is platform independent.

The main benefit of this tool that a user with Web skills like HTML and CSS
is able to generate PDF templates very quickly without learning new
technologies. 

Easy integration into Python frameworks like CherryPy,
KID Templating, TurboGears, Django, Zope, Plone, Google AppEngine (GAE) etc.
